Overview on X's rules and account behavior best practices Skip to main content Help Center Paid Partnerships policy While posts promoted through X's advertising services are labeled as âPromotedâ and must abide by our X Ads Policies, organic, non-promoted posts may also be considered paid product placements, endorsements, or advertisements (âPaid Partnershipsâ). The following are examples of Paid Partnerships: A user, including a creator or brand, has been or may be compensated for a post (including in the form of money, gifts, loans of products, or other rewards or incentives), or A post is created as part of, or in connection with, a commercial relationship (such as a current or recent âbrand ambassadorâ arrangement), or A post includes an affiliate link or discount code through which the user might receive some kind of benefit, incentive or reward posts that are part of a Paid Partnership posted as an organic post will require clear and prominent disclosures indicating the commercial nature of such content.For example, â#adâ, â#paidpartnershipâ, â#sponsoredâ. Failure to include an appropriate disclosure in a clear and prominent way could result in enforcement actions. In addition to abiding by the X Rules, users, including creators and brands, that participate in Paid Partnerships are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to, all advertising laws and, where applicable, FTC regulations including the FTCâs Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising. The rules and guidance that apply to Paid Partnerships may vary country to country, and can change, so check that you are following all the latest rules and guidance in the relevant country. The following also applies to the United Kingdom: Creators should include all applicable disclosures that are required to indicate the commercial nature of their content, such as â#adâ.Remember that all posts with commercial intent, including own-brand posts created by a user who has a commercial interest in the relevant brand (for example, as a director) will require a disclosure. Failure to include an appropriate disclosure, as mentioned in the global section above, in a clear and prominent way could result in enforcement actions. Creators may also check the Influencers' Guide to Making Clear that Ads are Ads as provided by Committee of Advertising Practice (CAP) and the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA). Users who believe they have viewed a Paid Partnership which does not include an appropriate disclosure, may report their concerns directly to the relevant brand or to an appropriate regulatory authority, such as the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
