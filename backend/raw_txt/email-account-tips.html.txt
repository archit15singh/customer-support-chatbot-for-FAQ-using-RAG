Email security checklist Use a strong, unique password and keep it safe.When you set up your account, be sure to choose a strong password (at least 10 characters that include upper and lower case characters, numbers, and symbols).Do not share your password with anyone.No matter how strong your password is, if someone else knows it, itâs no longer secure.Do not use the same password on multiple sites or for multiple accounts on the same site.One compromise can lead to many others.Do not use the same password for your email and X account. Use a password management system that will generate and store strong passwords for you.Both 1password and Lastpass are good options.Learn more For more information, you can visit the following links: Gmail: Choosing a Smart Password X Safety: Keeping Your Account Secure Connect Safely: Tips for Strong, Secure Passwords Delâs Blog My account has been compromised If you suspect your account has been compromised, you can find out what to do on our compromised accounts help page.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
