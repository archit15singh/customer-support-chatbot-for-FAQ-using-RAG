If you wish to grant a third-party app access to your account, we recommend that you only do so using Xâs OAuth method.OAuth is a secure connection method and doesnât require you to give your X username and password to the third party.You should be particularly cautious when you're asked to give your username and password to an app or website.When you give your username and password to someone else, they can gain complete control of your account and can lock you out or take actions that cause your account to be suspended.If you are unsure about whether a login page for a third-party app is using OAuth, go directly to X.com and enter your credentials there, and then navigate back to the app.If the app is using OAuth, the app should not require you to enter your username and password again.You can learn more about how to check that youâre on X.com with our account security tips.If you previously provided your password to an app that you are now unsure about, revoke its access on the Apps and sessions section of your account settings and change your password.Note: You should be especially wary of and never provide your username and password to: Websites claiming to help you âget more followers fast!â (see our following rules and best practices for more information).Apps which post affiliate ads to your timeline. If you suspect a bad app is still connected to your account Immediately revoke its access on the Apps and sessions section of your account settings and change your password.If you are experiencing problems with an app, please read the compromised accounts article for more information.If youâre having issues with a third-party app Because third-party apps are not owned and operated by X, we're not able to troubleshoot them.Itâs best to reach out to the app developer for answers to your questions or to let them know about a problem you're having with their product.Available tools Third-party tools created by developers add new functionalities and can enhance your X experience.These tools are self-serve, and many are free to use.You can learn more about some of the tools currently available below. Please note: Weâre early in our effort to make third- party tools available and discoverable.Additionally, some tools are created by Xâs internal development team.Although some of these tools are only available to specific devices and operating systems, we hope to extend access across all devices and operating systems. Tweet Tiles Post Tiles X's internal development team is currently experimenting with post Tiles, a way to attach customizable formats to a post. Right now, people on iOS and web may see and interact with post Tiles that include text, images, videos, or other elements like a button from people in the initial test group.These formats are designed to easily engage with content and make your timeline more dynamic and visual. When someone in our initial test group posts a post Tile, people on iOS and web who are part of this experiment will automatically see the post Tiles they post on the Home timeline.Like post Cards, post Tiles render automatically when you paste a URL. Please note: Not all followers will automatically see the post Tiles, and if you Repost a post Tile or share a post Tile URL, others might not be able to see it.
