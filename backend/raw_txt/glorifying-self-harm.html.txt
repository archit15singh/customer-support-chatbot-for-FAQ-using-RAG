X's suicide & self-harm policy | X Help Skip to main content Help Center Suicide and Self-harm policy Overview You may not promote or encourage suicide or self-harm.At X, we recognize that suicide and self-harm are significant social & public health challenges that require collaboration between all stakeholders â public, private, and civil society â and that we have a role and responsibility to help people access and receive support when they need it.When developing this policy, we consulted extensively with experts to ensure that people who have engaged in self-harm or experienced suicidal thoughts can share their personal experiences.We also recognized the need to protect people from the potential harm caused by exposure to content that could promote or encourage self-harm â intentionally or inadvertently.Thatâs why our policy prohibits content that promotes or encourages self-harming behaviors and provides support to those undergoing experiences with self-harm or suicidal thoughts. What is in violation of this policy? Under this policy, you canât promote, or otherwise encourage, suicide or self-harm.We define promotion and encouragement to include statements such as âthe most effectiveâ, âthe easiestâ, âthe bestâ, âthe most successfulâ, âyou shouldâ, âwhy donât youâ.Violations of this policy can occur via Posts, images or videos, including live video. We define suicide to be the act of taking oneâs own life.We define self-harm to include: self-inflicted physical injuries e.g., cutting; and eating disorders e.g., bulimia, anorexia. Violations of this policy include, but are not limited to: encouraging someone to physically harm or kill themselves; asking others for encouragement to engage in self-harm or suicide, including seeking partners for group suicides or suicide games; and sharing information, strategies, methods or instructions that would assist people to engage in self-harm and suicide. What is not a violation of this policy? Some examples of behavior that are not considered a violation of this policy include: sharing personal stories and experiences related to self-harm or suicide; sharing coping mechanisms and resources for addressing self-harm or suicidal thoughts; and discussions that are focused on research, advocacy, and education related to self-harm or suicide prevention. Note : people can share their personal experiences, but should avoid sharing detailed information about specific strategies or methods related to self-harm, as this could inadvertently encourage this behavior. Who can report violations of this policy? Anyone can report content that may encourage or promote suicide or self-harm via our in-app reporting or our specialized reporting form.These reports are routed to a dedicated team who evaluate each case individually. Note: if we receive a report that someone has expressed an intention to engage in self-harm or suicide, we will contact them directly, encourage them to seek support, and provide information about dedicated online and hotline resources.We may also work with law enforcement officials where appropriate, for example, if we receive a valid emergency disclosure request as defined in our Law Enforcement Guidelines.
