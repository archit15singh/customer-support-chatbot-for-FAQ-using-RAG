X RePost FAQS â deleting, RTs, and more Skip to main content Help Center RePost FAQs What is a Repost? A Repost is a re-posting of a post.X's Repost feature helps you and others quickly share that post with all of your followers.You can Repost your own posts or posts from someone else.Sometimes people type "RT" at the beginning of a post to indicate that they are re-posting someone else's content.This isn't an official X command or feature, but signifies that they are quoting another person's post.What does a Repost look like? Reposts look like normal posts with the author's name and username next to it, but are distinguished by the Repost icon and the name of the person who Reposted the post.If you see content from someone you do not follow in your timeline, look for Reposted by info in the postâthe Reposter should be someone you follow.Note: Reposts may appear differently in third-party applications, and will show up in apps only if they are using X's Repost API.Many apps have built in their own version of Repostingâthose posts are not treated as official Reposts on X.To test, try Reposting from a third-party app, then check your profile on the web.Where do Reposts appear? posts Reposted by other people: You can see posts people you follow have Reposted and Quote posted in your Home timeline.Repost and Quote posts, like regular posts, will not show up from accounts you have blocked.
