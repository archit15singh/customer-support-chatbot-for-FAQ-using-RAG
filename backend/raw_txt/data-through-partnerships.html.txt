How X shares information with our business partners Skip to main content Help Center Additional information sharing with business partners When X receives information about you, we use that information to improve our services, to personalize your X experience, and for other purposes as described in our Privacy Policy. In some cases, this involves sharing non-public personal information with our partners.For the partnerships described below, we provide you with additional control over whether your non-public personal data may be shared if you are located in the specified regions.You can exercise this control using the Allow additional information sharing with business partners setting in your Personalization and Data settings. Changes to this setting may not be immediate.The setting only applies to the particular types of partnerships described below ââ it does not affect how X otherwise shares data or through partnerships other than those described below.Additionally, though these partnerships may operate globally, the setting only applies in the specific regions as described below.This means that if a partnership is listed as being subject to the setting in a select region, then only X customers in that region can use the setting as described.For example, all X customers can use the setting as described in the âsubject to the setting for all X customers globallyâ section, but customers located in the EU, an EFTA state, or the United Kingdom can also use the setting as described in the âsubject to the setting for X customers located in the European Union, EFTA States, or the United Kingdomâ section. Partnerships, last updated April 6, 2020: Subject to the setting for all X customers globally: Other Advertising Platforms Through Which X Markets Itself: X shares certain non-public personal information with certain digital advertising platforms to help measure and optimize the effectiveness of our efforts to market X on those platforms.This information can include IP address and mobile device advertising identifiers for devices that open or log in to Xâs mobile apps; but does not include your name, email, phone number, or X username.These advertising platform partners act as data controllers for this information and the platforms we currently work with in this capacity are: Google [ Google's Privacy Policy ] Facebook [ Facebookâs Data Policy ] X may share this information with these partners before youâve signed up for X (e.g.when you first open the app before creating an account) as disclosed prior to download in the X app description in the App Store and Google Play, but does not offer you control over this data sharing until after youâve created a X account.Once youâve created a X account, if your Allow additional information sharing with business partners setting is disabled X will not thereafter share with these partners the non-public personal information described above.Separately, you may be able to control how these partners use this data by exercising privacy choices as described in their privacy policies linked above.For X customers who signed up prior to the last updated date above and who are located in the European Union, an EFTA State, or the United Kingdom, X does not currently share this information with these partners as described above even if your Allow additional information sharing with business partners setting is enabled.

X may share this information directly with advertisers that are not acting as data processors, but such advertisers more frequently access this data through data processor partnerships.Data processors act on behalf of X to facilitate measurement and analytics solutions for advertisers who run mobile application advertising campaigns through X.If you are located in the European Union, an EFTA state, or the United Kingdom, your Allow additional information sharing with business partners setting must be enabled in order for X and its data processors to share the non-public personal information described above with third parties that are not acting as data processors.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
