Tracking on iOS 14.5+ Skip to main content Help Center Tracking on iOS 14.5+ If you are using X for iOS 14.5 and up, X is required to request permission to track data on your device from other companies, like apps you use and websites you visit. For each iOS 14.5 and up device that you use X on, you will see a prompt from X providing information about Xâs tracking, followed by a tracking prompt from your iOS device for the X app. X discloses its tracking for the latest version of Xâs iOS app in its App Privacy section on the X product page in the App Store.You can learn more about how X handles your information, including tracking data on your device from other companies, in the X Privacy Policy. How can I control Xâs tracking on my iOS 14.5+ device? If you allow tracking through the prompting process described above, X will engage in tracking on the device that you granted the permission to track as described in our App Privacy section.If you choose not to allow tracking, X will not engage in tracking on that device. These choices only affect how X may or may not track data on the applicable device going forward, after you have responded to Xâs iOS 14.5+ tracking prompt. Your choice may not go into effect immediately.Regardless of whether you allowed or declined X permission to track you through the prompts described above, you can always go to your iOS device settings and select X to adjust whether to allow tracking.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
