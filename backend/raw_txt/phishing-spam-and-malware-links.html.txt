Our approach to blocking links | X Help Skip to main content Help Center Our approach to blocking links Overview July 2020 At times, X will take action to limit or prevent the spread of URL links to content outside X.This is done by displaying a warning notice when the link is clicked, or by blocking the link so that it canât be posted at all.We may take action to limit the spread of the following categories of links: Malicious links that could steal personal information or harm electronic devices.This includes: Links that contain or lead to malware Attempts at phishing Spammy links that mislead people or disrupt their experience.This includes: Malicious redirected links that send people to an unexpected destination Links associated with known platform manipulation campaigns URL shorteners that are primarily used to mislead or deceive people about the websiteâs content. Otherwise misleading or deceptive links; e.g., malicious affiliate links and clickjacking links Find out more about our platform manipulation and spam policy. Certain categories of content that, if posted directly on X, would violate our rules.This includes links to websites that feature: Terrorism and violent extremism Media, or other content created by terrorist organizations or violent extremist groups Recruitment sites for a terrorist organization or violent extremist group Child sexual exploitation (CSE) Media depicting CSE Identification of child survivors of sexual abuse Illegal or certain regulated goods or services Offers to buy, sell, or facilitate transactions in illegal goods or services, as well as certain types of regulated goods or services Hateful conduct Content that promotes violence against, threatens or harasses other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease Violence Content that threatens violence against an individual or a group of people, or glorifies violence where people were targeted because of their membership in a protected group, or the perpetrators of such acts Private information Other people's private information that was posted without their express authorization and permission Non-consensual nudity Intimate media of someone that was shared without their consent Content that interferes with civic and election integrity Misleading information about how to vote or register to vote Hacked material Content obtained through hacking that contains private information, may put people in physical harm or danger, or contains trade secrets Violent or misleading content that could lead to real-world harm in the aftermath of a crisis incident.This includes, but is not limited to, links to websites that contain: Manifestos associated with violent incidents Media that depicts acts associated with a violent incident How we surface links We use a combination of factors to identify links that we may ultimately take enforcement action against.We receive information about links from many sources, including: Third-party vendors who specialize in countering spam and malware Collaborative information sharing with industry peers and trusted NGO partners Internal technology and tools Reported posts Our enforcement options We consider several factors when deciding whether to introduce a warning notice to a link, or to prevent it from being shared on X.These considerations include: The source of the URL in question and our degree of certainty that the link is malicious or harmful.For example: Links reviewed by X may be blocked outright, whereas a warning notice may be applied to links we first become aware of via lower-confidence information sharing from trusted third parties The severity of the websiteâs content Context and apparent intent of the link sharer.For instance: We may treat newsworthy links shared by journalists differently than if the link were shared by someone else We may treat links to websites criticizing or commenting on content that violates our rules differently than links sharing the content straightforwardly or without commentary We may treat links with commentary glorifying a violent incident differently than links expressing outrage about the same incident Accounts dedicated to sharing content which we block, or which attempt to circumvent a block on the sharing a link, may be subject to additional enforcement action, including suspension.Learn more about our range of enforcement options.In some cases, the sharing of a link will also result in account suspension due to a zero-tolerance policy (for instance, if a link is shared to child sexual exploitation content).About blocked links If we have blocked a link, you will see an error message if you try to include it in your post or Direct Message, or on your profile.The message reads: âYou canât complete this action because this link has been identified by X or our partners as being potentially harmful.Please visit our Help Center to learn more.â About links that have warning notices In some instances, X will introduce a warning that the link may be unsafe.The warning notice can be clicked through if you wish to proceed to the third-party site.When a link has been categorized by X as meeting the criteria for a warning notice, it will also have limited visibility on X.Read more about limited post visibility. Miscategorized links We work at a rapid pace and in collaboration with third parties to stay on top of emerging malicious or harmful links.Sometimes, despite our best efforts, links can be miscategorized.If you notice that a link has been blocked or has a warning notice and you believe this is in error, you can report it to us via this form.In the âproblematic linkâ field, please insert the extended URL of the link, rather than a shortened version.Share this article Post X platform X.com Status Accessibility Embed a post Privacy Center Transparency Center Download the X app X Corp.About the company Company news Brand toolkit Jobs and internships Investors Help Help Center Using X X for creators Ads Help Center Managing your account Email Preference Center Rules and policies Contact us Developer resources Developer home Documentation Forums Communities Developer blog Engineering blog Developer terms Business resources Advertise X for business Resources and guides X for marketers Marketing insights Brand inspiration X Flight School © 2023 X Corp.Cookies MStV Transparenzangaben Impressum Privacy Terms and conditions English Help Center English EspaÃ±ol æ¥æ¬èª íêµ­ì´ PortuguÃªs Deutsch TÃ¼rkÃ§e FranÃ§ais Italiano Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ© Nederlands Bahasa Indonesia Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ à¤¹à¤¿à¤à¤¦à¥ ×¢××¨××ª ç®ä½ä¸­æ ç¹é«ä¸­æ à¸ à¸²à¸©à¸²à¹à¸à¸¢ Tiáº¿ng Viá»t Melayu Filipino ÙØ§Ø±Ø³Ûâ Dansk Suomi Svenska Norsk Polski Magyar RomÃ¢nÄ Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ CatalÃ Hrvatski Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸ SlovenÄina à²ªà²¾à²·à³à²à³ Dari Oromo Tigrinya Kurdish Did someone say â¦ cookies?
