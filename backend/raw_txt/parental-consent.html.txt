Understanding and obtaining parental consent to use X Skip to main content Help Center About parental consent on X X requires people using our service to be 13 years of age or older.In some countries, the law requires a parent or guardian to give consent for people older than 13, but under the age of consent in their country, to use our service.If you do not meet our age requirements, weâll lock your X account and youâll receive a notice from us letting you know that we need parental consent in order to re-activate it.Why is this happening? To meet legal requirements for online services where you live, if you do not meet our age requirements, weâll need to promptly lock your account until certain steps are taken.We understand this change is an abrupt and inconvenient disruption.Our goal, however, is to help navigate you through this process as smoothly as we can and to get you back to posting. What do we need from you? If you receive a parent consent notice for your account, and you otherwise meet the requirements to continue using our service, youâll be prompted to have your parent or guardian fill out this form.We recommend completing the form as soon as possible, as it can take up to 60 days to process your request. Weâll notify you through X when your account is up and running again.Note: When your account is eligible for restoration, youâll have 30 days to complete and submit your request, after which, youâll no longer be able to regain access to your account.What is the process like? Weâve aimed to make this as straightforward as possible for you.Hereâs the rundown: Weâll notify you through X that your account has been locked, and weâll need a parent or guardian to give consent to re- activate your X account.Your parent or guardian fills out this form ââ note that we require proof of identification and guardianship.(Any supporting documentation you send to us will be kept confidential and deleted from our systems after we review them.) Should we need more information as we start the process, weâll follow up with your parent or guardian.When youâre approved and cleared to get back into your account, weâll let you know.
